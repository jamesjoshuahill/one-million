# Algorithms

This section is more of a problem solving exercise in code. The task is
simple: the solution might not be.

The challenge here is to write a Ruby script that outputs every number
from 1 (one) to 1,000,000 (one million), but the output should be in
words. Example output is as follows:

```
one
two
three
...
one hundred and twelve
one hundred and thirteen
...
four hundred and seventeen thousand one hundred and
fifty four four hundred and seventeen thousand one
hundred and fifty five
...
nine hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred
and ninety nine one million
```
